This is a project for upscaling images using Deep-Image API.

Included is a YML file with the API specifications.

There are three samples images. These were used for upscaling and comparing with bicubic upscale. There is the original image (sample-img.jpg) which is 800 x 530 pixels, the upscaled image (sample-upscaled.jpg) and bicubic upscaled image (sample-bicubic.jpg). From these images, the quality can be compared.
